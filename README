Kernel Source Files

context_switch
  This file contains all the procedures used by the provided ContextSwitch procedure.
  Procedures:
    context_switch_helper
      For normal context switching between processes.
    idle_and_init_initialization
      For the initialization of the idle and init processes. Specifically, this initializes idle's
      SavedContext and gives init a copy of idle's kernel stack.
    child_process_region_0_initialization
      For initializing the child process in fork. Copies all valid region 0 pages from parent
      process to child and context switches to child.

kernel_start
  This is where the entry KernelStart procedure resides. The process for starting the kernel is as
  follows:
    1. Initialize array of free physical pages.
    2. Initialize interrupt vector table.
    3. Init kernel and user page tables.
    4. Create the idle process.
    5. Enable virtual memory.
    6. Create the init process.
    7. Load the idle process.
    8. Perform ContextSwitch with idle_and_init_initialization procedure.
    9. Load init.
    10. Init IO buffers.
    11. Run init.

load_program
  Uses modified load program template with added parameters:
    1. ExceptionStackFrame *frame
      The frame that contains the current stack pointer and program counter.
    2. struct pte *page_table_to_load
      Pointer to the page table of the process we are loading.
  
memory_management
  Contains procedures for dealing with memory.

  Specifically, it contains:
    1. The SetKernelBrk procedure
    2. Handler for the Brk kernel call.
    3. Procedure for growing user stack.
    4. Helper procedures for dealing with free physical pages.
  
page_table_management
  Contains procedures for managing page tables.

  Specifically, it contains:
    1. The linked list of free half physical pages to use when allocating memory for page tables.
        In order to ensure that page tables were physically contiguous in memory, we took advantage
        of the fact that a the size of a page table is PAGESIZE/2. These physical pages reside at
        the top of REGION_1.
    2. Contains helper procedures for creating, preparing, and freeing page tables.
 
process_control_block
  Contains the process control block (pcb) and helper procedures for creating and managing pcbs.

  Specifically, it includes the definition of the pcb, which includes these members:
    1. int pid
      Process id. There are two reserved pids, 0 for init and 1 for idle.
    2. struct pte *page_table
      A pointer to the page table corresponding to the process.
    3. SavedContext saved_context
      The SavedContext of the process.
    4. int delay
      The number of clock ticks reminaing until this process is unblocked.
    5. void *brk
      The address of the current brk.
    6. void *user_stack_limit
      The address of the current bottom of the user stack.
    7. struct exit_status_node *exit_status_queue
      A queue of information about child processes that have exited. Specifically that includes the
      exit status and pid of the child.
    8. int parent_pid
      The pid of the parent process. If this is an orphan process, parent_pid is -1.
    9. int out_of_memory
      This is specific to fork. It's a flag used to signify that there is not enough remaining
      memory to fork.
    10. int is_waiting
      Used to signify that the process is blocked due to a Wait call.
    11. int num_children
      The number of children currently running.
    12. int is_waiting_to_read_from_terminal
      This signifies that the process is waiting to read from a terminal. The value
      corresponds to the terminal number it is waiting to read from. If the process is not waiting
      to read from a terminal, the value is -1.
    13. int is_writing_to_terminal
      This signifies that the process is currently writing to a terminal. The value corresponds
      to the terminal number it is writing to. -1 if it is not writing.
    14. int is_waiting_to_write_to_terminal
      This signifies that the process is waiting to write to a terminal. The value corresponds
      to the terminal number it is waiting to write to. -1 if it is not waiting to write.
  
process_scheduling
  This contains procedures and structs for scheduling the running of processes.

  Specifically, it contains:
    1. A linked list whose nodes contain pcbs of all non-terminated processes.
    2. Whenever we want to schedule a process, we traverse the linked list and choose the first
        ready process. When selecting the next process to run, priority is given to any process
        that is not idle. Times when we select a new process include but are not limited to:
          - Delaying current process
          - When a process has children and calls Wait but there are no exit statuses to be
            collected. 
          - Switching due to two clock ticks occuring while the current process is running.
          - When a process wants to read or write, but needs to wait.
          - When the current process is exiting.
    3. Additional helper procedures for managing the scheduling of processes.
  
terminals
  This contains all code related to terminal i/o.

  Specifically it contains:
    1. Procedures for reading from/writing to terminals.
    2. Helper procedures to manage buffers.

trap_handlers
  This contains all code related to interrupt trap handlers.
